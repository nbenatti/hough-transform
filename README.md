C++ implementation of the [Hough transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform) algorithm.  
(For a simpler, less *Academic* explanation and a nice Python implementation, you may look [here](https://alyssaq.github.io/2014/understanding-hough-transform) ðŸ˜‰)

**Compile with:** `g++ hough.cpp [-Wall] -o[1|2|3] hough -std=c++11`  
**Usage:** `hough [input-image-path] [treshold]`

**NOTE:** the repo also contains some significative test images, which are stored in the `input_imgs` folder
